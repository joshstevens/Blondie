-- Blondie -- 

This is the README file for the 'Blondie Address Book' written by Josh Stevens.

-- What is Blondie? --

* Simple application that takes input from a database (textfile) and matches strings of characters on input.

-- What works --

* GUI
* The code runs!

-- What is to be implemented --

* A proper search function
* Ability to add names and numbers to the database
* Additional windows for help documentation
* Ability to send bug reports to Josh
* Licensing codes (just for fun!)

-- Why? --

This was originally a project developed by myself to learn how to code with Ruby and the Shoes GUI toolkit. This is a rewrite from scratch just to learn more about coding with Ruby. This is the first time I've uploaded it to Github, and the code available here will change overtime. 

The original GitGist can be found here - https://gist.github.com/1418007

(The above is awfully coded, just a learning process!)
